Target API Views
================

.. warning:: Check your groups!

    When creating a ``Target`` via the API, one of the accepted parameters is a list of groups that will have permission 
    to view the ``Target``. If you neglect to specify any groups, your ``Target`` will only be visible to the user that 
    created the ``Target``. Please be sure to specify groups!!

.. tip:: Better API documentation

    The available parameters for RESTful API calls are not available here. However, if you navigate to ``/api/targets/``
    and click the ``OPTIONS`` button, you can easily view all of the available parameters.

    From the ``GET`` view, you can experiment with the available filters and see an example of the request.
