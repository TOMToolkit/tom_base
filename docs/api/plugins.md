[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_antares)

#### Compatibility Notes

If you're on Mac OS, it should be noted that the Antares client library has a dependency
that only supports Mac OS 10.13 or later. If you try to run `./manage.py migrate` on an
earlier version, you may see an error.

### tom-nonsidereal-airmass

This module provides a templatetag supporting visibility plots for non-sidereal targets. This plugin is fully
supported by the TOM Toolkit team; however, non-sidereal visibility calculations require the PyEphem library, which is
minimally supported while its successor is in development. The library used for the TOM Toolkit sidereal visibility,
`astroplan`, does not yet support non-sidereal visibility calculations.

### tom-lt

This module provides the ability to submit observations to the Liverpool Telescope Phase 2 system. It is in a very
alpha state, with little error handling and minimal instrument options, but can successfully submit well-formed
observation requests.
