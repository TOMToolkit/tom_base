Creating an Alert Broker Module for the TOM Toolkit
###################################################

This guide will walk you through how to create a custom alert broker module using the TOM toolkit.

At the end of this tutorial we will have a very simple module that connects to
an "alert broker" (in this case a static json file) and allows us to ingest
targets into our TOM.

You can follow this example to build an alert broker module to connect to a real
alert broker.

Be sure you've followed the :doc:`Getting Started </introduction/getting_started>` guide before continuing onto this tutorial.

.. tip:: Read these first!

    The following Python/Django concepts are used in this tutorial. While this tutorial does not assume familiarity with the concepts, you will likely find the tutorial easier to understand and build upon if you read these in advance.

TOM Alerts module
*****************

The TOM Alerts module is a Django app which provides the methods and
classes needed to create a custom TOM alert broker module. A module may be created to ingest
alerts of an arbitrary form from a remote source. The TOM Alerts module provides
tools to transform these alerts into TOM-specific alerts to be used in the creation of TOM Targets.

Project Structure
*****************

After following the :doc:`Getting Started </introduction/getting_started>` guide, you will have
a Django project directory of the form:

.. code-block::

    mytom
    ├── db.sqlite3
    ├── manage.py
    └── mytom
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── settings.py
        ├── urls.py
        └── wsgi.py

Creating a Broker Module
************************

In this example, we will create a broker named __MyBroker__.

Begin by creating a file ``my_broker.py``, and placing it in the inner ``mytom/`` directory
of the project (in the directory with settings.py). ``my_broker.py`` will contain the classes that define our custom
TOM Alert Broker Module.

Our custom broker module relies on the TOM Toolkit modules that were installed in the
:doc:`Getting Started </introduction/getting_started>` guide. Begin by editing ``my_broker.py``
to import the necessary modules.

.. code-block:: python

    from tom_alerts.alerts import GenericQueryForm, GenericAlert, GenericBroker
    from tom_alerts.models import BrokerQuery
    from tom_targets.models import Target

In order to add custom forms to our broker module, we will also need Django's `forms` module, as well the Python module `requests`, which will allow us to fetch some remote broker test data.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from django import forms
    import requests

See `Working with Django Forms <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/forms/>`_ and the `Requests Official API Docs <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_.

Test Data
*********

In place of a remote broker, we've uploaded a `sample JSON file to GitHub Gist <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mgdaily/f5dfb4047aaeb393bf1996f0823e1064/raw/5e6a6142ff77e7eb783892f1d1d01b13489032cc/example_broker_data.json>`_.

For our ``my_broker.py`` module to use this data, we will set ``broker_url`` to it.

.. code-block:: python

    broker_url = 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mgdaily/f5dfb4047aaeb393bf1996f0823e1064/raw/5e6a6142ff77e7eb783892f1d1d01b13489032cc/example_broker_data.json'

Broker Forms
************

To define the query forms for our custom broker module, we'll begin by creating class
``MyBrokerForm`` inside ``my_broker.py``, which inherits the ``tom_alert`` module's
``GenericQueryForm``.

This will define the list of forms to be presented within the broker query. For
our example, we'll be querying simply on target name.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyBrokerForm(GenericQueryForm):
        target_name = forms.CharField(required=True)

Broker Class
************

To define our broker module, we'll create the class ``MyBroker``, also inside of ``my_broker.py``.
Our broker class will encapsulate the logic for making queries to a remote alert broker,
retrieving and sanitizing data, and creating TOM alerts from it.

Begin by defining the class, its name and default form. In our case, the name
will simply be 'MyBroker', and the form will be ``MyBrokerForm`` - the form that we
just defined!

.. code-block:: python
    
    class MyBroker(GenericBroker):
        name = 'MyBroker'
        form = MyBrokerForm

Required Broker Class Methods
=============================

Each TOM alert broker module is required to have a base set of class methods. These
methods enable the conversion of remote alert data into TOM-specific
alerts and targets.

``fetch_alerts`` Class Method
-----------------------------

`fetch_alerts` is used to query the remote broker, and return both an iterator
of results and any broker feedback received depending on the parameters passed into the query, so that
any results or feedback (such as error messages) may be displayed on the query results page. In our case, `fetch_alerts`
will only filter on name, but this can be easily extended to other query parameters.

.. code-block:: python
    
    @classmethod
    def fetch_alerts(clazz, parameters):
        broker_feedback = ''
        response = requests.get(broker_url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        test_alerts = response.json()
        alert_list = []
        try:
            alert_list = [alert for alert in test_alerts if alert['name'] == parameters['target_name']]
        except KeyError:  # We want to catch error messages returned from the Broker and pass them on as feedback.
            broker_feedback = test_alerts
        return iter(alert_list), broker_feedback

**Why an iterator?** Because some alert brokers work by sending streams, not fully
evaluated lists. This simple example broker could easily return a list (in fact we
are coercing the list into an iterator!) but that would not work in the model
where a broker is sending an unending stream of alerts.

Our implementation will get a response from our test broker source, check that our
request was successful, and if so, return a iterator of alerts whose name field matches the
name passed into the query. If the keyword 'name' isn't present in the alert, we pass the results
as feedback.

``to_generic_alert`` Class Method
---------------------------------

In order to standardize alerts and display them in a consistent manner,
the ``GenericAlert`` class has been defined within the ``tom_alerts`` library.
This broker method converts a remote alert into a TOM Toolkit ``GenericAlert``.

.. code-block:: python

    @classmethod
    def to_generic_alert(clazz, alert):
        return GenericAlert(
            timestamp=alert['timestamp'],
            url=broker_url,
            id=alert['id'],
            name=alert['name'],
            ra=alert['ra'],
            dec=alert['dec'],
            mag=alert['mag'],
            score=alert['score']
        )

In our case, the ``GenericAlert`` attributes match up *almost* directly with our test
data. How convenient! We'll just go ahead and define the ``GenericAlert``'s ``url``
field as the ``broker_url`` we retrieved our test data from.

.. code-block:: python
    
    ...
    url=broker_url,
    ...

Other methods
=============

``fetch_alerts`` and ``to_generic_alert`` are the only methods required for your
broker module to function. Of course you are free to add any number of additional
methods or attributes to the module that you deem necessary.

Using Our New Alert Broker
**************************

Now that we've created our TOM alert broker, let's hook it into our TOM
so that we can ingest alerts and create targets.

The ``tom_alerts`` module will look in ``settings.py`` for a list of alert
broker classes, so we'll need to add ``MyBroker`` to that list.

.. code-block:: python

    TOM_ALERT_CLASSES = [
        ...
        'tom_alerts.brokers.mars.MARSBroker',
        'mytom.my_broker.MyBroker',
        ...
    ]

Now, navigate to the top-level directory of your Django project,
where ``manage.py`` resides and run

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py runserver

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/alerts/query/list/ <http://127.0.0.1:8000/alerts/query/list/>`_

You should now see 'MyBroker' listed as a broker! Clicking the link will bring you
to the query page, where you can make a query to our sample dataset.

Making a Query
==============

Since we're only going to be filtering on the alert's 'target_name' field, we're only
presented with that option. Name the query whatever you'd like, and we'll check
our remote data source for a target named 'Tatooine'

.. image:: /_static/create_broker_doc/example_query.png

Going back to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/alerts/query/list/ <http://127.0.0.1:8000/alerts/query/list/>`_,
our new query will appear. Click the 'run' button to run the query.

.. image:: /_static/create_broker_doc/populated_query_list.png

The query result will be presented.

.. image:: /_static/create_broker_doc/query_result.png

To create a target from any query result, click the 'create target' button. To view the raw
alert data, click the 'view' link.
