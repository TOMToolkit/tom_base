About the TOM Toolkit
---------------------

What’s a TOM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It stands for Target and Observation Manager, and its a software package
designed to facilitate astronomical observing projects and
collaborations.

Though useful for a wide range of projects, TOM systems are particularly
important for programs with a large number of potential targets and/or
observations.

TOM systems perform some or all of these functions:

-  Harvest target alerts, or upload catalogs of targets of interest to
   the project science goals.
-  Search and cross-match additional information on targets from
   catalogs and archives.
-  Store information from the project’s own analysis of the targets,
   related data and observations.
-  Provide informative displays of the targets, data and observing
   program.
-  Provide flexible search capabilities on parameters that are relevant
   to the science.
-  Provide tools to plan appropriate observations.
-  Enable observations to be requested from telescope facilities.
-  Receive information about the status of observation requests.
-  Harvest data obtained as a result of their observing requests.
-  Facilitate the sharing of information and data.

Motivation for a TOM Toolkit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many projects, from several branches of astronomy, have found it
necessary to develop TOM systems. Current examples include the PTF
Marshall and NASA’s ExoFOP, as well as those customized for the LCO
Network: SNEx, NEO Exchange and RoboNet. These tools provide
capabilities which enable the projects to identify and evaluate high
priority targets in good time to plan and conduct suitable observations,
and to analyze the results. These capabilities have proven to be
essential for existing projects to keep track of their observing program
and to achieve their scientific goals. They are likely to become
increasingly vital as next generation surveys produce ever-larger and
more rapidly-evolving target lists.

However, designing the existing TOM systems required high levels of
expertise in database and software development that are not common among
astronomers.

No two TOM systems are identical, as astronomers strongly prefer to
directly control the science-specific aspects of their projects such as
target selection, observation templates and analysis techniques. At the
same time, while all of these systems are customized for the science
goals of the projects they support, much of their underlying
infrastructure and functions are very similar.

What’s needed is a software package that lets astronomers easily build a
TOM, customized to suit the needs of their project, without becoming an
IT expert or software engineer.

Financial Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TOM Toolkit is managed by Las Cumbres Observatory, with generous
financial support from the `National Science Foundation <https://www.nsf.gov/>`_ grant 2209852.
We are also grateful for support from the `Heising-Simons Foundation
<https://hsfoundation.org>`_ and the `Zegar Family Foundation
<https://sites.google.com/zegarff.org/site>`_ at the start of the project.
