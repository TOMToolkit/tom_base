Integrating Forced Photometry Service Queries
---------------------------------------------

The base TOM Toolkit comes with Atlas, panSTARRS, and ZTF query services. More services
can be added by extending the base ForcedPhotometryService implementation.


Integrating existing Forced Photometry Services
###############################################

You must add certain configuration to your TOM's ``settings.py`` to setup the existing forced
photometry services. This configuration will go in the ``FORCED_PHOTOMETRY_SERVICES`` section 
shown below:

.. code:: python

    FORCED_PHOTOMETRY_SERVICES = {
        'ATLAS': {
            'class': 'tom_dataproducts.forced_photometry.atlas.AtlasForcedPhotometryService',
            'url': "https://fallingstar-data.com/forcedphot",
            'api_key': os.getenv('ATLAS_FORCED_PHOTOMETRY_API_KEY', 'your atlas account api token')
        },
        # TODO: these services are coming soon...
        # 'PANSTARSS': {
        # },
        # 'ZTF': {
        # }
    }

    DATA_PRODUCT_TYPES = {
        ...
        'atlas_photometry': ('atlas_photometry', 'Atlas Photometry'),
        ...
    }

    DATA_PROCESSORS = {
        ...
        'atlas_photometry': 'tom_dataproducts.processors.atlas_processor.AtlasProcessor',
        ...
    }


Configuring your TOM to serve tasks asynchronously:
***************************************************

Several of the services are best suited to be queried asynchronously, especially if you plan to make large
queries that would take a long time. The TOM Toolkit is setup to use `dramatiq <https://dramatiq.io/index.html>`_
as an asynchronous task manager, but doing so requires you to run either a `redis <https://github.com/redis/redis>`_
or `rabbitmq <https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server>`_ server to act as the task queue. To use dramatiq with
a redis server, you would add the following to your ``settings.py``:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'django_dramatiq',
        ...
    ]

    DRAMATIQ_BROKER = {
        "BROKER": "dramatiq.brokers.redis.RedisBroker",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "url": "redis://your-redis-service-url:your-redis-port"
        },
        "MIDDLEWARE": [
            "dramatiq.middleware.AgeLimit",
            "dramatiq.middleware.TimeLimit",
            "dramatiq.middleware.Callbacks",
            "dramatiq.middleware.Retries",
            "django_dramatiq.middleware.DbConnectionsMiddleware",
        ]
    }

After adding the ``django_dramatiq`` installed app, you will need to run ``./manage.py migrate`` once to setup
its DB tables. If this configuration is set in your TOM, the existing services which support asynchronous queries,
Atlas and ZTF, should start querying asynchronously. (Note: You must also start the dramatiq workers:
``./manage.py rundramatic``. If you do not add these settings, those services will still function but will fall
back to synchronous queries.


Adding a new Forced Photometry Service
######################################

The Forced Photometry services fulfill an interface defined in 
`BaseForcedPhotometryService <https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/blob/dev/tom_dataproducts/forced_photometry/forced_photometry_service.py>`_.
To implement your own Forced Photometry service, you need to do 3 things:
1. Subclass BaseForcedPhotometryService
2. Subclass BaseForcedPhotometryQueryForm
3. Subclass DataProcessor
Once those are implemented, don't forget to update your settings for ``FORCED_PHOTOMETRY_SERVICES``, 
``DATA_PRODUCT_TYPES``, and ``DATA_PROCESSORS`` for your new service and its associated data product type.


Subclass BaseForcedPhotometryService:
*************************************

The most important method here is the ``query_service`` method which is where you put your service's business logic
for making the query, given the form parameters and target. This method is expected to create a DataProduct in the database
at the end of the query, storing the result file or files. If queries to your service are expected to take a long time and
you would like to make them asynchronously (not blocking the UI while calling), then follow the example in the
`atlas implementation <https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/blob/dev/tom_dataproducts/forced_photometry/atlas.py>`_ and place your
actual asynchronous query method in your module's ``tasks.py`` file so it can be found by dramatiq. Like in the atlas implementation,
your code should check to see if ``django_dramatiq`` is in the settings ``INSTALLED_APPS`` before trying to enqueue it with dramatiq.

The ``get_data_product_type`` method should return the name of your new data product type you are going to define a
DataProcessor for. This must match the name you add to ``DATA_PROCESSORS`` and ``DATA_PRODUCT_TYPES`` in your ``settings.py``.
You will also need to define a `DataProcessor <https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/blob/dev/tom_dataproducts/data_processor.py#L46>`
for this data type. 


Subclass BaseForcedPhotometryQueryForm:
***************************************

This class defines the form users will need to fill out to query the service. It uses
`django-crispy-forms <https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to define the layout
programmatically. You first will add whatever form fields you need to the base of your
subclass, and then just fill in the ``layout()`` method with a django-crispy-forms layout
for your fields, and optionally the ``clean()`` method if you want to perform any field validation.
The values of the fields from this form will be available to you in your service class in the
``query_service`` method.


Subclass DataProcessor:
***********************

You must create a custom DataProcessor that knows how to convert data returned from your service into
a series of either photometry or spectroscopy datums. Without defining this step, your queries will still
result in a DataProduct file being stored from the service's ``query_service`` method, but those files will
not be parsed into photometry or spectroscopy datums. You can read more about how to implement a custom 
DataProcessor `here <../customizing_data_processing>`_.
