Plotting Data
-------------

The TOM Toolkit provides a few basic plots, such as photometry,
spectroscopy and target distribution. Sometimes it would be useful to
visualize data in a different way.

If you want a different `plotly` theme than the one that comes standard, you can
change this by adding the following to your `settings.py` file:

::

    # Default Plotly theme setting, can set to any valid theme:
    # 'plotly', 'plotly_white', 'plotly_dark', 'ggplot2', 'seaborn', 'simple_white', 'none'
    PLOTLY_THEME = 'plotly_dark'


In this tutorial you will learn how to build and display a very simple
plot in our TOM: number of reduced data per target. The end result will
demonstrate how to create a `plot.ly <https://plot.ly>`__ plot with data
from our TOM. You will even package the code in it’s own app so we can
share it with other TOM users that might find it useful.

If you haven’t already read the documentation on `customizing
templates </customization/customize_templates>`__ you should read it
first. You’ll need to edit a template in order to view your new plot
somewhere.

First, start a new app in our project to house the new plot (and perhaps
other additions!):

::

   ./manage.py startapp myplots

This will create a new `Django
app <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app>`__
in your project named myplots:

::

   myplots
   ├── admin.py
   ├── apps.py
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── migrations
   │   └── __init__.py
   ├── models.py
   ├── tests.py
   └── views.py

   1 directory, 7 files

Note you don’t necessarily have to start a new app. If you’ve already
started an app that you’d like to reuse, that works too.

Now install the new app into your project’s settings.py file:

.. code:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       ...
       'myplots',
   ]

Now that the ``myplots`` app is installed, create the directories
necessary to contain your new plot:

::

   mkdir -p myplots/templates/myplots
   mkdir myplots/templatetags

The templates directory will contain the html template you can include
in other templates to display your plot. The templatetags directory will
contain the python code to construct the plot.ly plot.

Start by creating the
`templatetags <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/custom-template-tags/>`__
file:

::

   touch myplots/templatetags/myplots_tags.py

Edit this file, starting with the necessary imports:

.. code:: python

   from plotly import offline
   import plotly.graph_objs as go
   from django import template

   from tom_targets.models import Target

The ``plotly`` imports are needed for building an offline plot. The
django ``template`` import gives access to the template library, which
will allow for registering the template tag. Finally, the TOM Toolkit
``Target`` class will allow access to the ``Target`` model (for
querying).

Next, add the boiler plate code for a template tag:

.. code:: python

   register = template.Library()


   @register.inclusion_tag('myplots/targets_reduceddata.html')
   def targets_reduceddata(targets=Target.objects.all()):

First we instantiate the ``register`` decorator. You don’t need to know
much about this other that it allows us to register functions as
templatetags. The function ``targets_reduceddata`` is decorated with the
``register`` decorator, which takes as an argument the template to
render. The function definition takes in a queryset of ``Target``\ s as
a keyword argument, but if none are supplied, defaults to all
``Target``\ s in the database.

Next, add the function body:

.. code:: python

       # order targets by creation date
       targets = targets.order_by('-created')
       # x axis: target names. y axis: datum count
       data = [go.Bar(
           x=[target.name for target in targets],
           y=[target.reduceddatum_set.count() for target in targets]
       )]
       # Create the plot
       figure = offline.plot(go.Figure(data=data), output_type='div', show_link=False)
       # Add plot to the template context
       return {'figure': figure}

As the comments describe, the function code iterates over each
``Target`` in the ``targets`` queryset adding the target name and datum
count as x/y values to the ``Bar`` data structure. Check out the
`plot.ly bar chart documentation <https://plot.ly/python/bar-charts/>`__
for more information about the options available to you. As an exercise,
try changing the values in the y axis. Or you could use a different
chart type.

Finally, the code adds the plot.ly plot to the template rendering
context. Next we will create this template where this context will be
rendered.

Create the file, making sure it matches the template name specified in
the template tag definition beforehand:

::

   touch myplots/templates/myplots/targets_reduceddata.html

This file contains the simple contents:

::

   {% raw %}
   {{ figure|safe }}
   {% endraw %}

All this template does is output the ``figure`` variable, which is the
html generated from plotly in the templatetag. We also tell django that
the output is safe, so that it doesn’t escape the html. That’s it.

**Note:** If you’re running the development server, restart it now.
Django doesn’t automatically pick up new templatetags.

Now that the templatetag and template are complete, we can use it in any
template. You might have your own templates which you’d like to add the
plot to, or perhaps you’ve customized one of the TOM supplied templates
as per the `customizing
templates </customization/customize_templates>`__ documentation. Either
way, including the templatetag works the same way. At the top of the
template (after any ‘extends’) load the new tag library:

::

   {% raw %}
   {% load myplots_tags %}
   {% endraw %}

Now insert the templatetag somewhere in the template where you’d like it
to appear:

::

   {% raw %}
   {% targets_reduceddata %}
   {% endraw %}

If your parent template already has a queryset of targets available in
the context (for example, a target list page) you can pass it in to be
used in your plot:

::

   {% raw %}
   {% targets_reduceddata targets %}
   {% endraw %}

Otherwise the plot will simply use all targets in your database. Either
way, you should end up with something like this:

That’s it! Plot.ly provides a wide range of plotting capabilities, you
should reference `the documentation <https://plot.ly/python/>`__ for
more information. It would also be helpful to read `Django’s
ORM <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/>`__ to become
familiarized with wide range of methods of querying data.
