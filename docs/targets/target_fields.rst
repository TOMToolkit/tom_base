Adding Custom Fields to Targets
-------------------------------

Sometimes you’d like to store data for targets but the predefined fields
that the TOM Toolkit provides aren’t enough. The TOM Toolkit allows you
to define extra fields for your targets so you can associate different
kinds of data with them. For example, you might be studying high
redshift galaxies. In this case, it would make sense to be able to store
the redshift of your targets. You could then do a search for targets
with a redshift less than or greater than a particular value, or use the
redshift value to make decisions in your science code.

The TOM Toolkit currently supports two different methods for adding extra
fields to targets: Extending Target Models and adding Extra Fields.

Extending the Target Model
==========================
Users can extend the ``Target`` model by creating a custom target model in the app
where they store their custom code. This method is more flexible and allows for
more intuitive relationships between the new target fields and other code the user
may create. This method requires database migrations and a greater understanding of
Django models to implement.

By default the TOM Toolkit will use the ``tom_targets.BaseTarget`` model as the target model,
but users can create their own target model by subclassing ``tom_targets.BaseTarget`` and adding
their own fields. The TOM Toolkit will then use the custom target model if it is defined
in the ``TARGET_MODEL_CLASS`` setting of ``settings.py``. To implement this a user will first
have to edit a ``models.py`` file in their custom code app and define a custom target model.

Subclassing ``tom_targets.BaseTarget`` will give the user access to all the fields and methods
of the ``BaseTarget`` model, but the user can also add their own fields and methods to the custom
target model. Fields from the ``BaseTarget`` model will be stored in a separate table from the custom
fields, and rely on separate migrations. See the
`Django documentation on multi-table inheritance. <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/models/#multi-table-inheritance>`__

Preparing your project for custom Target Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing your project will need is a custom app. If you already have a custom app
(usually called ``custom_code``) you can skip this section. You can read
about custom apps in the Django tutorial
`here <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/>`__, but
to quickly get started, the command to create a new app is as follows:

.. code:: python

   ./manage.py startapp custom_code

Where ``custom_code`` is the name of your app. You will also need to
ensure that ``custom_code`` is in your ``settings.py``. Append it to the
end of ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

.. code:: python

   ...
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       ...
       'tom_dataproducts',
       'custom_code',
   ]
   ...

You should now have a directory within your TOM called ``custom_code``,
which looks like this:

::

   ├── custom_code
   |   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── admin.py
   │   ├── apps.py
   │   ├── models.py
   │   ├── tests.py
   │   └── views.py
   ├── data
   ├── db.sqlite3
   ├── manage.py
   ├── mytom
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── settings.py
   │   ├── urls.py
   │   └── wsgi.py
   ├── static
   ├── templates
   └── tmp

Editing ``models.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First you will need to create a custom target model in the ``models.py`` file of your custom app.
The following is an example of a custom target model that adds a boolean field and a number field:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: models.py
    :linenos:

    from django.db import models

    from tom_targets.base_models import BaseTarget


    class UserDefinedTarget(BaseTarget):
        example_bool = models.BooleanField(default=False)
        example_number = models.FloatField(default=0)

        # Set Hidden Fields
        example_bool.hidden = True

        class Meta:
            verbose_name = "target"
            permissions = (
                ('view_target', 'View Target'),
                ('add_target', 'Add Target'),
                ('change_target', 'Change Target'),
                ('delete_target', 'Delete Target'),
            )

The model name, ``UserDefinedTarget`` in the example (line 6), can be replaced by whatever CamelCase name you want, but
it must be a subclass of ``tom_targets.BaseTarget``. The permissions in the class Meta (lines 15-20) are required for the
TOM Toolkit to work properly. The ``hidden`` attribute can be set to ``True`` to hide the field from the target
detail page.

Editing ``settings.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next you will need to tell the TOM Toolkit to use your custom target model. In the ``settings.py`` file of your
project, you will need to add the following line:

.. code:: python

    TARGET_MODEL_CLASS = 'custom_code.models.UserDefinedTarget'

Changing ``custom_code`` to the name of your custom app and ``UserDefinedTarget`` to the name of your custom target model.

Creating Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you have created your custom target model, you will need to create a migration for it. To do this, run the
following command:

.. code:: python

    ./manage.py makemigrations

This will create a migration file in the ``migrations`` directory of your custom app. You can then apply the migration
by running:

.. code:: python

    ./manage.py migrate

This will build the appropriate tables in your database for your custom target model.

Convert old targets to new model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have existing targets in your database, you will need to convert them to the new model. This can be done by
running a version of the following code. We incorporate this into a management command to make it easier to run.

Create a new file in your custom app called ``management/commands/convert_targets.py`` and add the following code:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: convert_targets.py
    :linenos:

    from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

    from tom_targets.base_models import BaseTarget
    from tom_targets.models import Target


    class Command(BaseCommand):
        """
        Core code based on information found at
        https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/7623
        """

        help = 'A helper command to convert existing BaseTargets to UserDefinedTargets.'

        def handle(self, *args, **options):
            # Make sure Target is a subclass of BaseTarget
            if Target != BaseTarget and issubclass(Target, BaseTarget):
                self.stdout.write(f'{Target} is a subclass of BaseTarget, updating existing Targets.')
                base_targets = BaseTarget.objects.all()
                targets = Target.objects.all()
                for base_target in base_targets:
                    # If the base_target is not already in the new target model, update it
                    # Note: subclassed models share a PK with their parent
                    if not targets.filter(pk=base_target.pk).exists():
                        self.stdout.write(f'Updating {base_target}...')
                        target = Target(basetarget_ptr_id=base_target.pk)  # Create a new target with the base_target PK
                        target.__dict__.update(base_target.__dict__)  # add base_target fields to target dictionary
                        target.save()
                self.stdout.write(f'{Target.objects.count()} Targets updated.')

            return

Once this file is created, you can run the following command to convert your old targets to the new model:

.. code:: python

    ./manage.py convert_targets

Once this command is run, all of your old targets will be converted to the new model, but will not have the new fields
filled in. You will need to fill in these fields manually, but once you do any non-hidden fields will be displayed on
the target detail page.

Any fields added in this way are fully accessible in the TOM Toolkit as ``Target``, and can be used in the same way
as the built-in fields from any custom code you write, the API, or from the admin interface.


Transferring existing ``Extra Field`` Data to your ``Target`` Fields
====================================================================

If you have been using ``Extra Fields`` and have now created a custom target model, you may want to transfer the data
from the ``Extra Fields`` to the new fields in your custom target model. This can be done by running a management
command called ``converttargetextras``.  To use this command, be sure to have already created your custom target model.
You can run the command without arguments for an interactive walkthrough.

.. code:: python

    ./manage.py converttargetextras

Alternatively, you can run the command with the ``--target_extra`` and/or ``--model_field`` flags to specify one or
more the of the ``Extra Field`` and ``Target Field`` names respectively.

.. code:: python

    ./manage.py converttargetextras --target_extra extra_bool extra_number --model_field example_bool example_number

This command will go through each target and transfer the data from the ``Extra Field`` to the ``Target Field``. If the
``Target Field`` is already populated, the data will not be transferred. When finished, the ``Extra Field`` data will be
deleted, and you will likely want to remove the ``EXTRA_FIELDS`` setting from your ``settings.py`` file.

Adding ``Extra Fields``
=======================
If a user does not want to create a custom target model, they can use the ``EXTRA_FIELDS``
setting to add extra fields to the ``Target`` model. This method is simpler and does not require
any database migrations, but is less flexible than creating a custom target model.

**Note**: There is a performance hit when using extra fields. Try to use
the built in fields whenever possible.

Enabling extra fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start, find the ``EXTRA_FIELDS`` definition in your ``settings.py``:

.. code:: python

   # Define extra target fields here. Types can be any of "number", "string", "boolean" or "datetime"
   # For example:
   # EXTRA_FIELDS = [
   #     {'name': 'redshift', 'type': 'number'},
   #     {'name': 'discoverer', 'type': 'string'}
   #     {'name': 'eligible', 'type': 'boolean'},
   #     {'name': 'dicovery_date', 'type': 'datetime'}
   # ]
   EXTRA_FIELDS = []

We can define any number of extra fields in the array. Each item in the
array is a dictionary with two values: name and type. Name is simply
what you would like to name your field. Type is the datatype of the
field and can be one of: ``number``, ``string``, ``boolean`` or
``datetime``. These types allow the TOM Toolkit to properly store,
filter and display these values elsewhere.

As an example, let’s change the setting to look like this:

.. code:: python

    EXTRA_FIELDS = [
        {'name': 'redshift', 'type': 'number'},
    ]

This will make an extra field with the name “redshift” and a type of
“number” available to add to our targets.

Using extra fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now if you go to the target creation page, you should see the new field
available:

|image0|

And if we go to our list of targets, we should see redshift as a field
available to filter on:

|image1|

Extra fields with the ``number`` type allow filtering on range of
values. The same goes for fields with the ``datetime`` type. ``string``
types to a case insensitive inclusive search, and ``boolean`` fields to
a simple matching comparison.

Of course, redshift does appear on our target’s display page as well:

|image2|

To hide extra fields from the target page, we can set the “hidden” key
(this doesn’t affect filtering and searching):

.. code:: python

    EXTRA_FIELDS = [
        {'name': 'redshift', 'type': 'number', 'hidden': True},
    ]

And we can set a default value for an extra field by including a default
key/value pair:

.. code:: python

    EXTRA_FIELDS = [
        {'name': 'redshift', 'type': 'number', 'default': 0},
    ]

Displaying extra fields in templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we want to display the redshift in other places, we can use a
template filter to do that. For example, we might want to display the
redshift value in the target list table.

At the top of our template make sure to load ``targets_extras``:

::

   {% raw %}
    {% load targets_extras %}
   {% endraw %}

Now we can use the ``target_extra_field`` filter wherever a target
object is available in the template context:

::

   {% raw %}
    {{ target|target_extra_field:"redshift" }}
   {% endraw %}

The result is the redshift value being printed on the template:

|image3|

Working with extra fields programatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’d like to update or save extra fields to your targets in code,
there are a few methods you can use. The simplest is to simply pass in a
dictionary of extra data to your target’s ``save()`` method using the
``extras`` keyword argument:

.. code:: python

   target = Target.objects.get(name='example')
   target.save(extras={'foo': 42})

The example target above will now have an extra field “foo” with the
value 42.

For more precise control, you can access ``TargetExtra`` models
directly. To remove an extra, for example:

.. code:: python

   target = Target.objects.get(name='example')
   target_extra = target.targetextra_set.get(key='foo')
   target_extra.delete()

The above deleted the target extra on a target with the key of “foo”.
