The TOM Toolkit is a web framework for building TOMs: Target and Observation
Managers. TOMs are meant to facilitate collaborative astronomical observing
projects. A typical TOM allows it's users to curate target lists, request
observations of those targets at various observatories as well as manage and
organize their data. [Read more](https://tomtoolkit.github.io/about/) about TOMs.

## Getting started with the TOM Toolkit
The [getting started guide](https://tomtoolkit.github.io/docs/getting_started)
will guide you through the process of setting up a TOM for the first time.
